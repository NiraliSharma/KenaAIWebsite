1. Project Overview & Context
Company Name: KeNaAI

Project Goal: Develop an impressive, investor-focused website for fund-raising. The site must showcase KeNaAI's vision as a smart, AI-powered platform for all types of retail and convenience stores.

Tone: Professional, visionary, confident, and data-centric. All features should be presented as future capabilities ("Will provide," "Designed to work," etc.) since the product is in the planning/MVP stage.

Call to Action: The primary CTA is "Investment Discussion" and general inquiry, not "Schedule a Demo."

2. Technical and Architectural Requirements
Framework: React.js (functional components).

Structure: The project must use a modular structure, avoiding a single file. Organize code into logical components (e.g., src/components/, src/pages/).

Styling: Use a modern CSS approach (e.g., Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules) for clean, responsive styling.

Responsiveness: Must be thoroughly tested and fully responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Deployment: The code should be structured as a standard React application ready for deployment (e.g., on Vercel, Netlify, or similar services).

Version Control: The final, tested code will be committed to a new feature branch (e.g., feat/investor-website).

3. Design and Theming Specifications
Primary Accent Color: #ED6042 (A vibrant coral/red-orange). This color should be used for all primary CTAs, headings, key data highlights, and hover states.

Theme: Dark/Black Theme. Use near-black (#111111 or #0A0A0A) for backgrounds and light grays/white for main text.

Visuals: Use placeholders for high-quality visual assets. Insert tags like `` or [Short video clip of customer movement heatmap] for every feature section to guide future asset creation. The goal is to make the site look visually rich and advanced.

4. Required Website Sections and Content
The website must be structured with the following sections in order:

A. Hero Section (KeNaAI)
Headline: Focus on the core value proposition (e.g., "The Future of Retail Efficiency: AI-Powered Intelligence for Small Stores.")

Subtext: Emphasize affordability, ease of deployment, and scalability.

Primary CTA: "Investment Discussion" or "Partner with Us."

B. The Core Platform: MVP Focus
This section will introduce the modular system concept.

Detail each of the MVP Features below, using the "will be" phrasing:

Real-Time Inventory Tracking: Will monitor stock levels, trigger low-stock alerts, and display data on a dashboard.

Customer Dwell Time Analytics: Will track customer time in zones and generate heatmaps for traffic analysis. [Short video clip of customer movement heatmap]

Basic Staff Movement Tracking (Privacy-First): Will monitor time spent restocking and detect idle zones.

Anomaly Alerts: Will detect and alert on suspicious behavior (e.g., potential loss prevention events).

C. How KeNaAI Will Work
Provide a simple, 3-4 step process illustrating the deployment and value flow.

Step 1: Simple Camera Integration: Utilise existing or affordable, easy-to-install cameras.

Step 2: AI Vision Processing: KeNaAI's platform will process the video feed via the cloud.

Step 3: Real-Time Insights: Data will be pushed to the owner's dashboard and used to trigger alerts.

D. Future Growth: Add-On Modules
Use a professional heading like "Future Capabilities: The KeNaAI Modular Ecosystem" or "Planned Development Roadmap."

Briefly describe the more advanced features as future offerings:

Autonomous Billing (Checkout-Free Experience):


* **Advanced Analytics & Reporting**
* **Predictive Inventory Management**
* **POS & ERP Integration:** (Emphasize "Will work with your current POS...")
* **Smart Signage / Dynamic Ads**
E. Market Opportunity & Investor Value
Why Invest? Provide a space for key statistics (using placeholder text for now) on the size of the small/mid-sized retail market, projected efficiency gains (e.g., "Potential to reduce shrinkage by 20-40%"), and ROI.

Market Impact: Discuss how the product will democratize advanced retail tech, making it accessible and affordable, thereby leveling the playing field against large chains.

F. Demo Video Placeholder
A section titled "KeNaAI in Action (Concept Demo)" with a large placeholder for a future embedded video demonstrating the dashboard/alerts.

G. Contact & Investment Inquiry
Section Title: "Partner with KeNaAI: Join Our Vision."

Form Fields: Name, Company, Email, Phone, and an Inquiry Type dropdown (Investment Discussion, Partnership Inquiry, General Question).

Final CTA: "Submit Inquiry."

5. Final Instructions for Copilot
Strictly adhere to the dark theme and the accent color #ED6042.

Focus on the MVP section (B) as the primary content driver.

Do not generate a "Schedule a Demo" button anywhere.

Use the required future-tense language (e.g., "Will be implemented," "Is designed to...").

Ensure all necessary React components are created (Header, Footer, FeatureCard, ContactForm, etc.).
